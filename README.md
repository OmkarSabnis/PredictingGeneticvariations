# PredictingGeneticvariations
Classification of Genetic Mutations based Clinical text so as to predict their effects on Personalized Medicine <br>

To run this code, you will need: <br>
Numpy - Version: 1.14.3 <br>
Pandas - Version: 0.22.0 <br>
Seaborn - Version: 0.8.1 <br>
Matplotlib - Version: 2.2.2 <br>
NLTK, Re, Sklearn and lightgbm modules <br>

To execute the classifier: 
Download the repository and run the Genetic_Variations.py file.
Change the path to the dataset as per your system!
The dataset is in the repository: <br>
  Training Variants - Contains the description of the genetic mutations for training <br>
  Training Text - Contains the clinical evidence to classify the mutations <br.
  Test variants - Contains the description of the genetic mutations for testing <br>
  Test Text - Contains the clinincal evidence to classify the mutations <br>
The sample submissions file holds the classification results. <br>
